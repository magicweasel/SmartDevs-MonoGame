# SmartDevs Game

The following game was hacked together in just over an hour at a [MonoGame talk I delivered at SmartDevs in Hereford](https://www.meetup.com/Smart-Devs-User-Group/events/239295634/) based on some ideas from the session attendees.

The base of the game was copied and pasted from other projects and the internet and as such maybe a little rough!

**!!!Please Note!!!** Install MonoGame before running as it's
set to use the assembly from the GAK and not NuGet.

Installer can be found here: [MonoGame Website](http://www.monogame.net)

Installing MonoGame this way gives you access to the UI
tool for building your content.

## Looking around ...
