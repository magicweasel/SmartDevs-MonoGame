# SmartDevs Game

The following game was hacked together in an hour at
my MonoGame session at SmartDevs in Hereford.

The base of the game was copied and pasted from other
projects and the internet and as such maybe a little
rough!

**Please Note** Install MonoGame before running as it's
set to use the assembly from the GAK and not NuGet.

Installing MonoGame this way gives you access to the UI
tool for building your content.

## Looking around ...
